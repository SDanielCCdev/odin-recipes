            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Bring the water to a boil with the corn, cinnamon sticks, and cloves in a large pot. Reduce heat to
                medium-low; simmer 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a mesh strainer to remove the
                corn and spices. Stir the lemon juice and sugar into the chicha until the sugar has dissolved.
                Refrigerate until cold.</p>
